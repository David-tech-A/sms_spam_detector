## 📜 Description

The **SMS Spam Detector** is a machine learning project designed to classify SMS text messages as either "Spam" or "Not Spam" (Ham). It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as **TF-IDF vectorization** and the **Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC)** to make predictions. This project includes an interactive user interface powered by **Gradio**, allowing users to test the model in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Combines TF-IDF vectorization and LinearSVC for robust text classification.
- **Interactive UI**: A web-based interface using Gradio for easy interaction and testing.
- **Customizable**: Extendable to include additional models or features.
- **Preloaded Dataset**: Based on SMS spam datasets widely used in NLP tasks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language
- **Scikit-learn**: For model building and pipeline
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation
- **Gradio**: For creating the user interface
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For developing and visualizing the code

---

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/David-tech-A/sms_spam_detector.git
cd sms_spam_detector
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
It is recommended to create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate          # On Windows
```

Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If a `requirements.txt` file is missing, install manually:
```
pip install pandas scikit-learn gradio notebook
```

### 3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks
Start Jupyter Notebook and open the following files:
- `sms_text_classification_solution.ipynb`: Train and validate the ML model.
- `gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb`: Run the Gradio app.

To start the Gradio app:
```
!python gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb
```

### 4. Open the App
After running the Gradio app, a link (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) will be generated. Open it in your browser and test the SMS classifier.

---

## 📊 Example Messages to Test
Here are some example SMS messages you can test:
1. `You are a lucky winner of $5000!`
2. `You won 2 free tickets to the Super Bowl.`
3. `Call us at 12345 to claim your prize.`
4. `Hey, just checking in, see you at 5 PM.`
5. `Thanks for registering! Text STOP to opt out.`

---

## 🧠 Model Training
1. The dataset (`SMSSpamCollection.csv`) was split into **training** (67%) and **testing** (33%) sets.
2. The pipeline includes:
   - **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text into numerical features.
   - **LinearSVC**: A robust Support Vector Machine classifier.
3. Model achieved an accuracy of approximately **97%** on the test set.

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Add more advanced models like **Logistic Regression** or **Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT)**.
- Include additional preprocessing techniques such as **stemming** or **lemmatization**.
- Deploy the app using **AWS**, **Heroku**, or **Streamlit Cloud** for public access.
